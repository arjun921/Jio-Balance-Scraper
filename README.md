# Jio-Balance-Scraper
Logs into your Jio account and scrapes for the latest internet balance.

Something from the private vault.  Lets just say I was too damn lazy to do the same thing over and over again.ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ

So I built a Google Assitant Action which lets me ask, "How much data balance do I have left?". 

This is what runs in the backend to send me a return value.  Uses phantomjs to run on heroku, which means no window! 

Running it in head attached mode using chrome driver and it looks something like the video below.
